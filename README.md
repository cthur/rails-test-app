# README

Ruby on Rails tutorial which can be found here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Ruby version: 2.3.1p112
Rails version: 5.0.0

The purpose for this rails application is to help refresh my rails knowledge. I've studied and created rails apps in college, and now I want to start creating and working on rails again. I'm using this tutorial because it has a great, in-depth look at rails and working with its MVC framework.
